[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project aims to develop **Machine Learning** models to predict the occurrence of **Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** in patients. By analyzing various health attributes, the project identifies patients at risk for CHD, facilitating early intervention and better healthcare outcomes.

## 📊 Dataset Attributes
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- **male:** Is the patient male? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **age:** Age of the patient (in years)
- **education:** Patient's level of education (0 to 4, where 0 is the lowest and 4 is the highest)
- **currentSmoker:** Does the patient smoke currently? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **cigsPerDay:** Number of cigarettes smoked per day
- **BPMeds:** Does the patient take BP medications? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **prevalentStroke:** Has the patient had a stroke before? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **prevalentHyp:** Does the patient have hypertension? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **diabetes:** Is the patient diabetic? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **totChol:** Total cholesterol of the patient (in mg/dL)
- **sysBP:** Systolic blood pressure (in mmHg)
- **diaBP:** Diastolic blood pressure (in mmHg)
- **BMI:** Body mass index (kg/m²)
- **heartRate:** Heart rate (beats per minute)
- **glucose:** Glucose level (in mg/dL)
- **TenYearCHD:** Target variable (0 = No Risk, 1 = Risk of occurrence of CHD)

## 🛠️ Machine Learning Models Developed
The following models were trained and evaluated:
1️⃣ Logistic Regression  
2️⃣ Decision Tree Classifier  
3️⃣ KNN Classifier  
4️⃣ SVM Classifier  

## 📈 Model Performance
The project evaluates the performance of each model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring a robust comparison of the models' effectiveness in predicting CHD risk.

## 📚 Libraries Used
1️⃣ Pandas  
2️⃣ Scikit-learn  
3️⃣ Seaborn  
4️⃣ Matplotlib  

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Collect patient data from reliable sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize the data to uncover patterns and relationships.
4. **Model Training:** Train various machine learning models on the dataset.
5. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

## 🎨 Visualizations
Include insightful visualizations to showcase the relationships between features and the target variable, such as:
- Correlation heatmaps
- Distribution plots of key features
- Model performance comparison graphs

## 🚀 Future Work
- Explore advanced algorithms such as ensemble methods for improved prediction.
- Implement a web-based application for user-friendly access to predictions.
- Gather more diverse datasets to enhance model robustness.
